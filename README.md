# City-App-MVVM
It is a basic application applying the Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) that takes data about cities and stores them into Room database.

The main focus of the project is the implementation of MVVM architecture on a simple and basic app. Therefore much emphasis is not on the
UI design or functionality of the mobile app. A point to note is that the display button on the app shows city objects that are in the database to Logcat
in Android Studio.
